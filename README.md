# Hertz Freerider Notification System
This tool allows you to track new rides published on hertzfreerider.se, letting you grab them as they appear.

# Usage
Run the script by using:
```console
python hertz.py --from-locations "Malmö" "Lund" "Hässleholm" --to "Stockholm" "Göteborg"
```

This will find any routes from either Malmö/Lund/Hässleholm to Stockholm/Göteborg, refreshing every 10 seconds.
